                        <p>The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warns that soil pollution threatens food safety and human health. The FAO urges countries to take action to prevent soil pollution through sustainable agricultural practices.Certainly! The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has identified soil pollution as a major threat to global food safety and human health. Soil pollution can result from a range of activities, including industrial activities, the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and the improper disposal of waste.

                            Soil pollution can affect food safety and security by reducing crop yields, contaminating food crops, and posing a risk to human health. Pollutants in soil can be absorbed by plants, which can then be consumed by animals and humans. This can lead to the accumulation of harmful substances in the human body, which can cause a range of health problems, including respiratory illness, skin irritation, and cancer</p>
